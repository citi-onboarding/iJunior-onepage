## How are we going to run the project?

The project was divided into a few stages:

1. *Wireframe* production, followed by its validation;
2. *High fidelity mockup*, followed by its validation;
3. *Development Sprint 1*, where the back-end will be structured;
4. *Development Sprint 2*, where the front-end will be componentized;
5. *Development Sprint 3*, whose main goals are integration and deploy;
6. *Final project delivery*;

The activities are divided among the members, who concentrate daily for alignment in the project. Each issue has a deadline and is marked by specific tags (in order of priority, for example), and the organization is by Notion and GitHub!

### Oh, and [this one](https://www.notion.so/citiufpe/Squad-Shellyda-7685d1b80c0e4f589feeaba891aecd31) is our Notion!

## Which are the defaults used for branches and commits?

- For branches appointments, we use specific tags (bugfix e feature) before the slash in your name. After the slash, we specify the branch detail. These names must be in english.
- There are two main branches: main (production) and develop (development).
- For commits appointments, we also use feature and bugfix tags. The structure is as follows: Feature(branch-name): Description; or Bugfix(branch-name): Description; Commits must be in english too.
